        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p> Reddit is made up of over 120,000 "sub-reddits". One cannot possibly know what each contains, not only because some "sub-reddits"' title is misleading to the actual content, but also because of the sheer multitude. As such, with our app, we'd like to make it possible for any reddit user, be they new to reddit or a veteran, to post their submission into the most approriate "sub-reddit". There they'll hopefully either find what they're looking for in the right community.</p>

        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p> Our app functions on the basis of triangulating the purpose and content of the user's post, and the right "sub-reddit" to post in.To do this, the app filters through the "sub-reddit's" title and post submissions in order to find the most fitting within the 100,000 plus communities. </p>
