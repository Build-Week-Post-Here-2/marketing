    <h2> Figuring out where the best place to post your content is on Reddit can be daunting. We set out to fix that.</h2>

    <p>Why: As both veteran and new Reddit users know, Reddit is a <span class="emphasis">huge</span> community -- if you don't already know where you're going, it's easy to get overhwelmed in all of your choices. The interests and variety of each subreddit, their individual posting rules, and the even etiquette of each subreddit as a whole can be intimidating, so we set out to solve this problem. </p>

    <p>How:  By implimenting an easy-to-navigate website, designing key features around user-input, and building a cohesive environment to foster a better relationship with the Reddit platform.</p>
